Using LDAP for authentication and local realm file for roles
=====================

This configuration uses LDAP for authentication, and uses a realm property file for user roles.

The user authentication is defined in LDAP, and the groups are defined in the realm.properties file.

**LDAP Users:**

* `username: build`

  `password: build`

* `username: admin`

  `password: admin`
